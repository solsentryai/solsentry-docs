### Solana's Threat Intelligence Graph — Autonomous Operator-Level Detection

> **"RugCheck tells you a fire is burning. SolSentry tells you who lit it — and where they're going next."**

SolSentry is an autonomous threat intelligence system for Solana that tracks **operators**, not just tokens.  
While existing tools analyze each token or wallet in isolation, SolSentry maps the people behind the scams — across deployments, across wallets, over time.

## The Problem

Serial scam operators on Solana deploy dozens of rug pulls using different wallets, rotating bot clusters, and paid KOL networks. Each new token looks clean on launch.

Existing tools analyze tokens in isolation — RugCheck flags insider holders within a single token. SolScanner maps wallet connections when you ask. ChainAware scores individual wallet fraud probability. But nobody connects a serial deployer's latest token to their previous attacks.

The gap isn't token-level detection — it's **cross-attack operator intelligence**.

## Case Study — Operator 4kxscute

SolSentry's hunter agents were already tracking deployer wallet `4kxscute` as part of a **coordinated bot cluster** — wallets sharing SOL funding sources and executing same-block buy patterns across multiple tokens.

When 4kxscute deployed a new token, the hunter fired instantly:

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Risk Score | **100/100** |
| Holders | 1 |
| Top Holder Ownership | 100% |
| Flags | MINT_AUTHORITY_ENABLED, FREEZE_AUTHORITY_ENABLED, TOP_HOLDER_OWNS_100%, VERY_FEW_HOLDERS |
| Detection method | Hunter agent already tracking operator + auto-scan on new deploy |

**No other tool connected this deploy to the operator's previous activity.**  
SolSentry already knew who he was.

### Live Alert Output

## ALife Agent Ecosystem

SolSentry uses **Artificial Life principles** — inspired by Tierra, Avida, and Conway's Game of Life — to evolve its detection agents autonomously.

- **30 agents** with 7-gene DNA (spawn_threshold, max_hunters, risk_weight, etc.)
- **Fitness tracking** — agents that predict accurately gain energy and reproduce
- **Genetic mutation** — 30+ real mutations recorded with autonomous timestamps
- **Natural selection** — ineffective agents are culled at 2x population cap
- **Energy metabolism** — -0.3 per tick, births cost 15 energy
- **MetaLearning** — market regime detection (CALM/SURGE/CRASH/MEME) every 120s

This isn't marketing: `genome.json` contains recorded mutations showing parameter changes like `spawn_threshold` evolving from 70 → 95 and `max_hunters` from 10 → 30.

## Social Graph of Scam

Three entity types linked across every scan:

| Entity | Description | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **OperatorProfiles** | Serial deployer identities tracked across wallets | 109 operators, 847 wallets |
| **BotClusters** | Coordinated wallet groups (same-block buys, shared funding) | 229 clusters |
| **ShillNetworks** | KOL-to-operator connections via early-buy patterns | 106 KOLs tracked |

Every scan cross-references the graph. The more the system scans, the harder it is for operators to hide behind new wallets.
